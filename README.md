# GUS

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/Johann-S/gus/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Johann-S/gus/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)


Github User Search (GUS), available here: https://gus-johann-s.netlify.app/

## Highlights

- HTTP calls results are cached using the session storage
- Images are preloaded on scroll to load only what's necessary
- Good responsiveness to support different screen sizes
- CSS is purged using PurgeCSS to keep only what's used in the application
- Several filters are available (Best matches, Followers, Repositories and Joined)
- Keep track of the previous research you made and suggest them

## Most proud of

Here I tried to focus more on improving the app size to deliver a fast loading app and an optimized one.

## What's next?

- Another page for github users to display more information
- Switch to GraphQL API to avoid making several calls
